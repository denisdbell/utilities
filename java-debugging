## Steps to identify inefficent process in java
#.Show all processes
top -H (get pid eg 1234) 

#Alternatively JPS can be used as well, this will show only java processes
jps -l

# 2.Use PID to attach the process to jstack 
jstack 1234 

# 3. Show all threads within the process 
jenkins top -H -p 1234 (eg 4597)

# 4. Convert tread id to Hexadecimal (printf "%x\n" 4567 4597=11d7 in hex)
# this will find the specific thread which is causing the issue.
jstack 1234 | grep -A 30 "nid=0x11d7"

# 5. Dump results can be exported using
jstack 1234 > thread-dump.txt

# 6. docker cp [containername]:<container-dir> <host-dir> 

# 7. Upload results thread-dump.txt
